# Impact-of-BoC-Rates-on-Auto-Loans-and-Car-Sales

## Executive Summary 
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of the Bank of Canada (BoC) interest rates on auto lenders and car buyers. Specifically, the study aims to understand how changes in the BoC interest rates affect auto loan interest rates, new car sales, and household credit liabilities for auto loans. The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations for auto lenders, car buyers, and policymakers. 

## Problem Statement
Understanding how Bank of Canada interest rate adjustments affect auto loan interest rates, new car sales, and household credit liabilities is crucial for stakeholders in the automotive finance market. Auto loans represent a significant share of personal loans, making it essential to analyze their dynamics in response to changes in central bank policies. Despite its importance, there is limited comprehensive analysis available that quantifies these relationships and provides actionable insights. 

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected data from Bank of Canada and Statistics Canada. 
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned data to ensure consistency, removed bank holiday from the dataset. 
   - Merged datasets on the 'Date' column to create a unified dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted trend analysis and correlation analysis to identify key patterns and relationships.

4. **Statistical Regression Analysis**:
   - Performed multiple regression analyses to quantify relationships and predict outcomes:
     - BoC Interest Rates vs. Auto Loan Interest Rates
     - Auto Loan Interest Rates vs. New Car Sales Units
     - Funds Advanced for Auto Loans vs. New Motor Vehicles Sales Value
     - Auto Loan Interest Rates vs. Household Credit Liabilities

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Extracting, cleaning, and merging data from various sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
- **Statistical Analysis and Modeling**: Performing regression analyses to understand and predict relationships between variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data to communicate findings effectively.
- **Technical Documentation**: Documenting the project workflow, methodology, and results.
- **Communication**: Summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

## Key Findings

The analysis indicated a strong positive relationship between the Bank of Canada (BoC) rates and auto loan lenders' interest rates, with the BoC interest rate explaining 88% of the variation in the auto loan lenders' rate. A percent increase in the Bank of Canada rates would result in an increase of 0.8 percent in the auto loan lenders' rate. While auto loan rates do not seem to have any significant impact on new car sales, the funds advanced for these loans have a strong positive relationship with the sales value, with 65% of the variation in sales value being explained by the funds advanced. An increase in funds advanced for auto loans by a million dollars results in an increase in the value of new cars sold by $1.9 million. Lastly, auto loan interest rates explain 69% of the variability in auto loan debt consolidated, and a percent increase in the auto loan rates could result in an increase in auto loan liabilities by $4 billion.

## Recommendations

**For Auto Lenders**:
- Act swiftly when interest rates change to adjust their loan rates accordingly.
- Enhance credit risk management practices, as the increase in debt makes lending riskier.

**For Car Buyers**:
- Secure auto loans before anticipated interest rate hikes to benefit from lower rates.
- Evaluate different loan terms and consider the total cost of borrowing, including interest and fees.

**For Policymakers**:
- Closely monitor the levels of household debt associated with auto loans to ensure financial stability and prevent excessive debt accumulation, as these liabilities account for a significant portion of personal loans.
- Conduct regular assessments of the economic impact of interest rate changes on the auto lending market and overall consumer debt.
- Use these insights to guide monetary policy decisions to maintain a balanced and stable economy.
